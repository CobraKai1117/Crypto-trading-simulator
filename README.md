# Crypto-trading-simulator
Simulates Crypto trading at a centralized exchange


This simulation allows users to practice trading crypto with fake money. The user creates an account which is stored in a database. The user logs on to their and can make buy/sell transactions. Pricing is based on real time price feeds. For simplicity and limits of scope, this project will only act as a centralized exchange like Coinbase instead of a decentralized exchange like Uniswap.
